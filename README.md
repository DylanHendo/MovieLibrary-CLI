# Movie Library CLI

## Description
In the development of this software application, I used specified data structures to store and manipulate some data, and applied some algorithms to solve some computational problems in the software application, and analyse the time complexity of the algorithms.

The community library lends movie DVDs to its members. The information about a movie includes title, starring, director, duration, genre, classification, and release date. The genre of a movie may be Drama, Adventure, Family, Action, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Animated, Thriller, or Other. A movie is classified as General (G), Parental Guidance (PG), Mature (M15+), or Mature Accompanied (MA15+). The community library may have multiple DVDs of the same movie.

In order to borrow movie DVDs, members must register with the system through a librarian. When members are registered with the system, their full name, residential address, and a contact phone number are recorded in the system. The system also keeps the information about the movie DVDs that are currently being borrowed by each of the registered members.

When a registered member borrows a movie DVD, the movie DVD is added to the member’s record; and when the member returns the movie DVD to the community library, the movie DVD is removed from the member’s record. A registered member can borrow up to 10 movies at any time. However, none can borrow multiple copies of the same movie at the same time. It is assumed that both the full names of members and the titles of movies are unique.
